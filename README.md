# Hydrophobic

This plugin makes players stop gliding and start swimming with elytra upon touching water or lava.

Usually, when a player enters water while gliding with elytra, they can't stop gliding unless they touch the ground. This causes movement in the water to be difficult and wastes durability on the elytra.
